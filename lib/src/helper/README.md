# Helper Directory

The `helper` directory in this Flutter project contains several `.dart` files that serve as helpers for different functionalities of the application. Specifically, it includes `network.dart` for handling network requests, and `settings_storage.dart` for managing settings storage within the application.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `helper` directory is to store reusable code snippets and functions that provide support for specific tasks or functionalities. By organizing related helper functions into separate files, it becomes easier to manage, reuse, and maintain these code snippets throughout the project.

## File Structure

Within the `helper` directory, you may find multiple `.dart` files, each addressing a distinct aspect of application functionality. Let's explore two specific files commonly found in this directory:

### `network.dart`

The `network.dart` file contains functions and classes that facilitate making HTTP requests to external APIs or servers. These functions handle operations such as performing GET and POST requests, handling response data, and managing error scenarios. The file structure may resemble the following:

```plaintext
helper/
├── network.dart
├── settings_storage.dart
└── ...
```

### `settings_storage.dart`

The `settings_storage.dart` file focuses on handling the storage and retrieval of application settings. It contains functions that manage the persistent storage of user preferences, configurations, or any other settings required by the application. An example file structure could look like this:

```plaintext
helper/
├── network.dart
├── settings_storage.dart
└── ...
```

## Functionality and Integration

Let's explore the specific functionalities provided by each file and how they integrate into the overall application:

### `network.dart`

The `network.dart` file typically includes functions or classes that wrap common HTTP client libraries or utilize Flutter-specific networking libraries. These functions might handle tasks such as:

- Making GET and POST requests to fetch or send data to external APIs.
- Parsing response data into usable formats (e.g., JSON parsing).

These networking functions can be integrated into various parts of the application, such as:

- Retrieving data from an API to populate UI elements.
- Submitting user-generated data to a KitsuDeck/server.
- Fetching data from a KitsuDeck/server to populate UI elements.

### `settings_storage.dart`

The `settings_storage.dart` file focuses on storing and retrieving application settings or user preferences. It may include functions or classes that handle tasks such as:

- Storing and retrieving user preferences or configurations locally.
- Persisting settings across application sessions.
- Encrypting sensitive settings for added security.

These settings storage functions are commonly integrated into areas like:

- Managing user-specific preferences, such as theme selection or language settings.
- Storing KitsuDeck settings securely.
- Saving and retrieving application-specific settings.
